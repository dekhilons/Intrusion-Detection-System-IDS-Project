# Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-Project
This project involved developing a machine learning-based intrusion detection system with my team, following the CRISP-DM methodology. We used Python and Jupyter Notebook for implementation, conducted data preprocessing, model training and evaluation to identify security threats.

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

An IDS is a security system that monitors network traffic or system activity for malicious behavior.
It aims to identify potential security threats, such as unauthorized access attempts, denial-of-service attacks, or malware infections.
Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly popular for building effective IDS systems due to their ability to learn patterns from network traffic data and detect anomalies that might indicate an attack.

**Basic Data Description**

The project leverages the NSL-KDD dataset, a collection of labeled network traffic data meticulously categorized into normal and attack types (DoS, DDoS, U2R, Probe). This dataset offers a significant advantage over its predecessor, the KDD Cup 99 data, by eliminating redundancy and irrelevant features. The NSL-KDD data contains rich features extracted from network traffic, providing valuable insights for machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. By analyzing these features, the system aims to learn the intricate patterns that distinguish normal network activity from malicious cyberattacks.
